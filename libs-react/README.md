# SKYUX React Workspace

This directory contains a standalone Nx workspace used for React components that mirror the Angular SKYUX libraries.

Run the following commands from this directory:

```bash
npm install      # install dependencies
npm run build    # build all libraries
npm run test     # execute tests
```

Individual libraries can be built or tested with `nx build <project>` and `nx test <project>`.
